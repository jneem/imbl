# imbl

Blazing fast immutable collection datatypes for Rust.

This is a fork of the [`im`](https://github.com/bodil/im-rs) crate, which
appears to be unmaintained. The `1.0` release of `imbl` is compatible with the
`15.0.0` release of `im`, but with some fixes to `OrdMap` and `OrdSet`.

## Documentation

* [API docs](https://docs.rs/imbl/)

## Minimum supported rust version

This crate supports rust 1.51 and later. As const generics become more useful,
the minimum supported rust version will increase.
